# OpenViking Agent Plugins (Agent Plugins 1.0)

Portable [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification) package for [OpenViking](https://github.com/volcengine/OpenViking): long-term semantic memory and context for coding agents.

Agent Plugins 1.0 is a vendor-neutral packaging format for extending AI coding agents, backed by Amazon, Cursor, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Vercel among others. A plugin is a plain directory with a `plugin.json` manifest, auto-discovered Agent Skills under `skills/`, and optional MCP server declarations in `mcp.json` — one package that any conforming client (Cursor, VS Code, Amazon- and OpenAI-side clients, ...) can load the same way. This directory is that package for OpenViking.

## What's inside

```
plugin.json                          # Agent Plugins 1.0 manifest
mcp.json                             # stdio MCP server: "openviking"
servers/mcp-proxy.mjs                # stdio -> streamable-HTTP proxy to the OV server's /mcp
servers/shared/                      # generated from examples/memory-plugin-shared/lib (do not edit)
skills/openviking-memory/SKILL.md    # teaches the model the recall + persist loop
skills/ov-memory-troubleshoot/       # read-only extraction troubleshooting
skills/ov-experience-memory/         # retrieve and apply prior task Experience
skills/openviking-skills/            # find, use, create, and share OpenViking skills
plugin.test.mjs                      # node --test conformance checks
```

Use `ov-memory-troubleshoot` to trace backward from a memory file to its archive diff and, when needed, session messages. Diagnosis is read-only.

`ov-experience-memory` has the model search `viking://~/memories/experiences` with `find` or `search` before executable work and `read` the one to three Experience files that apply. In this package it is retrieval-only: without hooks nothing commits the conversation as a session, so its reads are not linked back to the Experience they used and produce no new trajectories. The Experience it retrieves comes from harnesses that do capture sessions, such as Claude Code and Codex.

`openviking-skills` covers the skills stored in OpenViking itself: how to find one with `find(context_type="skill")`, read and follow its `SKILL.md`, create or replace one with the `add_skill` MCP tool, install one from Git or a local folder, share one with the account, and move local skill folders into OpenViking when you ask. This package has no session-start hook, so there is no `<available-skills>` catalog here and the skill has the model search for a skill instead.

Zero npm dependencies; the proxy and tests run on the Node.js standard library (Node 18+ for global `fetch`).

## Install

1. Have an OpenViking server reachable (see the [quickstart](../docs/en/getting-started/02-quickstart.md)); default local endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:1933`.
2. Point your Agent-Plugins-conforming client at this directory (each client has its own install command or plugin directory; consult its docs). The client will:
   - register the `openviking` MCP server from `mcp.json` — it runs `node <plugin>/servers/mcp-proxy.mjs` over stdio;
   - discover the `openviking-memory`, `ov-memory-troubleshoot`, `ov-experience-memory`, and `openviking-skills` skills from `skills/`.
3. Configure credentials (next section) and start a session. The model gains `find` / `search` / `read` / `remember` / `write` / `add_skill` and the other OpenViking MCP tools. Use `search` with `mode="context"` for server-assembled context.

## Why a stdio proxy instead of a `streamable-http` entry

OpenViking already speaks streamable HTTP at `/mcp`, but a `streamable-http` entry in `mcp.json` cannot work portably: the server URL is per-deployment (localhost for one user, a remote endpoint for another), and the Agent Plugins spec forbids credentials in the static `headers` map. The stdio proxy solves both — it resolves the URL and API key at runtime from the same local sources as the `ov` CLI, injects them per request, and forwards JSON-RPC over streamable HTTP unchanged.

## Credential resolution

Highest to lowest priority (same chain as the `ov` CLI and the other OpenViking plugins):

1. Environment variables: `OPENVIKING_URL` (or `OPENVIKING_BASE_URL`), `OPENVIKING_API_KEY` (or `OPENVIKING_BEARER_TOKEN`), `OPENVIKING_ACCOUNT`, `OPENVIKING_USER`, `OPENVIKING_PEER_ID`
2. `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf` (`url`, `api_key`, `account`, `user`, then the `plugin.agent_plugins` and `plugin` keys) — override the path with `OPENVIKING_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`
3. `~/.openviking/ov.conf` `agent_plugins` section, then its `server` section (`url` or `host`/`port`, `root_api_key`) — override the path with `OPENVIKING_CONFIG_FILE`
4. Defaults: `http://127.0.0.1:1933`, no auth (local mode)

Config file changes are picked up by the running proxy without a restart. Debugging: set `OPENVIKING_DEBUG=1` to log JSON lines to `~/.openviking/logs/agent-plugins.log` (path override: `OPENVIKING_DEBUG_LOG`).

## Scope: what this package does and doesn't do

This package is the portable recall + write surface: skills plus MCP tools, driven by the model. Agent Plugins 1.0 deliberately excludes hooks, commands, and agents, so **automatic conversation capture and automatic pre-prompt recall are out of scope here** — the `skills/openviking-memory` skill instead teaches the model to recall at task start and persist durable facts via `remember`/`write` itself.

**If your harness has a hook system, prefer the dedicated plugin** — hook-driven recall and capture cost no tool calls and don't depend on the model choosing to remember. One installer covers Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, TRAE / TRAE CN, ZCode, OpenCode, and pi; it prompts for language, harnesses, download source, and credentials, and is idempotent:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcengine/OpenViking/main/examples/memory-plugin-shared/install.sh)
# GitHub hard to reach? Same installer from the Volcengine TOS mirror:
bash <(curl -fsSL https://ovrelease.tos-cn-beijing.volces.com/memory-plugin-shared/install.sh)
```

- [claude-code-memory-plugin](../examples/claude-code-memory-plugin/) (Claude Code)
- [codex-memory-plugin](../examples/codex-memory-plugin/) (Codex)
- [opencode-plugin](../examples/opencode-plugin/) (OpenCode)
- [agent-hook-plugin](../examples/agent-hook-plugin/) (Cursor, TRAE, TRAE CN, ZCode), ...

Use this Agent Plugins package for harnesses with no hooks, or when you want one package that loads across many clients.

Per the spec, client-specific integrations may later be embedded in this package under reverse-domain namespaced directories (e.g. `com.example.client/`) or the manifest's `extensions` object without breaking other clients.

## Development

```bash
node --test agent-plugins/plugin.test.mjs
```

`servers/shared/*.mjs` are generated, verbatim copies from `examples/memory-plugin-shared/lib` — do not edit them here. This directory is a target of the shared-lib sync script, so refresh them with:

```bash
node examples/memory-plugin-shared/sync.mjs
```

`examples/memory-plugin-shared/sync.test.mjs` fails if they drift, and pins this package to the connection half of the shared runtime: `servers/mcp-proxy.mjs` resolves everything through `buildProxyConnection()` in `shared/credentials.mjs` — the same `resolveConnection()` every other plugin's hooks and proxy use — so the hook-tuning knobs — which this spec has no hooks to run — never enter the bundle.

Both test files run in CI via `.github/workflows/pr.yml`.
