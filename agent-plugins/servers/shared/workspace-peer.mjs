 * Which peer a workspace writes its memories under.

 * turned into a dash, which made the identity an accident of where the
 * repository happened to sit: a clone on another machine, a rename, a worktree
 * or simply `cd examples/` each minted a separate, empty namespace. The default
 * is now git's own idea of the repository, so one project keeps one memory
 * wherever it is checked out.
 *
 * `peer.source` decides the rule. Presets cover the three answers most people
 * want; a template — or a list of templates tried in order — covers the rest.
 * The old behaviour is still one word away, byte for byte.

 * resolved it the other way round, which meant one ovcli.conf produced two
 * different peers depending on which host read it.
 *

 * It gets its own rank rather than riding the credential chain, which drops it
