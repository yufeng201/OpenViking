"""Read the R / N / F / V snapshots used by resource update planning.

This module gathers the typed R/N/F/V inputs used by the canonical resource
update plan.

- ``R`` normalized request intent — target, processing mode, and scalar fields
  such as tags that this request explicitly wants to mutate.

- ``N`` new-artifact manifest — the files a parser produced, read from the
  parse output store. Canonical add-resource prepares it once before planning:
  image references are rewritten to their final URI and their final-byte md5 is
  retained in the resulting inventory.
- ``F`` target file tree — one unbounded ``tree`` call. Any permission-denied
  subtree (or a truncated scan) marks the snapshot incomplete so the planner
  refuses deletions instead of treating unreadable files as removed.
- ``V`` target vectors — lightweight L0/L1/L2 records under the target URI.

The canonical ``add_resources`` path resolves these snapshots into a
``ResourceDiffResult`` before building a ``ContextUpdatePlan``.
