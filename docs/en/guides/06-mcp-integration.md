# MCP Integration Guide

OpenViking server has a built-in [MCP (Model Context Protocol)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) endpoint, allowing any MCP-compatible client to access its memory and resource capabilities over HTTP — no additional processes needed.

> **Quick setup?** See [MCP Clients](../agent-integrations/06-mcp-clients.md) for client configuration snippets and platform-specific notes. This page covers the full tool reference and advanced configuration.

## Prerequisites

1. OpenViking installed (`pip install openviking` or from source)
2. A valid configuration file (see [Configuration Guide](01-configuration.md))
3. `openviking-server` running (see [Deployment Guide](03-deployment.md))

The MCP endpoint is at `http://<server>:1933/mcp`, sharing the same process and port as the REST API.

## Verified Platforms

The following platforms have been successfully integrated with OpenViking MCP:

| Platform | Integration Method |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Claude Code** | `type: http` |
| **Trae** | Standard MCP config |
| **Cursor** | Standard MCP config |
| **ChatGPT & Codex** | Standard MCP config |
| **OpenCode** | Native OpenCode `mcp` config |
| **Manus** | Standard MCP config |
| **Claude.ai / Claude Desktop** | Native OAuth 2.1 (see [11-oauth](11-oauth.md)) |

## Authentication

The MCP endpoint shares the same API-Key authentication system as the OpenViking REST API. Pass either header:

- `X-Api-Key: <your-key>`
- `Authorization: Bearer <your-key>`

No authentication is required in local dev mode (server bound to localhost).

## Client Configuration

### Generic MCP Clients

Most MCP-compatible platforms (Trae, Manus, Cursor, etc.) use the standard `mcpServers` format:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openviking": {
      "url": "https://your-server.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

Claude Code requires `"type": "http"`. Add via CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http openviking \
  https://your-server.com/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here"
```

Or in `.mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openviking": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://your-server.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Add `--scope user` to make the config global (shared across all projects).

### OpenCode

Configure `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "openviking": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://your-server.com/mcp",
      "enabled": true,
      "oauth": false,
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop (OAuth)

These clients only accept OAuth 2.1 — API Keys cannot be passed directly.
OpenViking ships a native OAuth 2.1 implementation (DCR + PKCE + opaque
tokens, backed by SQLite, with a Studio consent screen for authorization) so
no external proxy is needed.

If you already have HTTPS configured, just connect to `https://your-server.com/mcp` — the client will walk you through the authorization flow automatically.

**See the [OAuth 2.1 Guide](11-oauth.md)** and **[Public Access Guide](12-public-access.md)** for:

- End-to-end flow (device-flow style: page displays a 6-character code,
  user confirms in the OpenViking console)
- HTTP (local) and HTTPS (production) deployment, including Caddy and nginx
  reverse-proxy templates plus a docker-compose example
- Connecting Claude.ai / Claude Desktop step by step
- `OPENVIKING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` and the `oauth` config block
- Token model (`ovat_` / `ovrt_` / `ovac_` prefixes) and revocation

> The community [MCP-Key2OAuth](https://github.com/t0saki/MCP-Key2OAuth)
> Cloudflare Worker proxy is still around and remains a valid third-party
> option, but the native flow is recommended now: no extra deployment unit,
> no third-party trust boundary on the API key.


## Available MCP Tools

Once connected, OpenViking exposes 16 tools:

| Tool | Description | Key Parameters |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| `find` | Fast semantic retrieval without session context. `context_type="skill"` on its own switches to package-level skill retrieval: one hit per skill package, its URI pointing at that package's `SKILL.md` and its summary taken from the skill itself, even when an auxiliary file inside the package is what matched. Without `target_uri` it searches both your own skills and the account-shared `viking://agent/skills`. Mixing `skill` with another context type keeps the generic retrieval path | `query`, `target_uri` (optional), `limit`, `min_score`, `level` (optional), `context_type` (optional), `read_content` (optional — inline each hit's content) |
| `search` | Deep semantic retrieval; `mode="context"` assembles injection-ready context and replaces the former `recall` tool. `list` mode also returns one hit per skill package, its URI pointing at `SKILL.md` and its summary taken from the package itself, but `limit` applies before that merge, so a package matching in several files takes several slots and fewer than `limit` results come back | `query`, `mode` (`list` or `context`), `target_uri` (list mode only), `session_id` (optional), `limit`, `min_score`, `level` (list mode), `context_type` (optional), plus context-mode `quotas`, `purpose`, `max_tokens`, `detail` or `detail_by_category`, `dedup_turns`, `exclude_uris`, `peer_scope`, scalar `other_peer_penalty` or `other_peer_penalties` by category, and `rewrite` (`off` or `auto`) |
| `read` | Read one or more `viking://` URIs. PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP return native MCP image content; WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, and M4A return native audio content. Video is not supported because MCP has no standard video content block | `uris` (single string or array) |
| `list` | List entries under a `viking://` directory | `uri`, `recursive`, `offset`, `limit`, `sort_by`, `sort_order` (optional) |
| `tree` | Show the recursive directory tree under a `viking://` URI, indented by depth — use when you need a full picture of the file tree (prefer `list` for a single level, `glob` for filename patterns) | `uri` (optional), `level_limit` (default 3), `node_limit` (default 1000), `offset`, `limit`, `include_abstract` (optional — also show each directory's summary; for a skill directory that is its name and description) |
| `remember` | Store messages into long-term memory (triggers extraction) | `messages` (list of `{role, content}`) |
| `write` | Write text to a `viking://` file (create/overwrite/append). Parent directories are created automatically; use `read` first to see current content before overwriting, and prefer `edit` for changing part of an existing file. Skill packages are not maintained this way: the caller's own `skills/` subtree is refused, and a write under `viking://agent/skills` produces a plain file that skips skill installation — use `add_skill` | `uri`, `content`, `mode` (optional: `replace` default — overwrites or creates if missing; `append` — appends or creates if missing; `create` — fails if it exists), `wait` (optional, block until re-indexed), `timeout` (optional) |
| `edit` | Replace an exact string with new text in an existing `viking://` file — for targeted changes instead of a full rewrite. The file is left unchanged if `old_string` is not found, or matches multiple times while `replace_all` is false. Editing a file inside a skill package does not re-run skill installation — use `add_skill` | `uri`, `old_string`, `new_string`, `replace_all` (optional), `wait` (optional, block until re-indexed), `timeout` (optional) |
| `add_resource` | Add a local file or URL as a resource (local files trigger a progressive upload flow) | `path`, `temp_file_id` (optional), `description` (optional), `watch_interval` (optional, minutes — auto-refresh cadence for remote URLs), `processing_mode` (optional: `semantic_and_vectors` default, or `vectors_only` to skip VLM semantic understanding and only vectorize current files), `to` (optional, target `viking://resources/...` URI; if omitted when `watch_interval > 0`, the watch auto-binds to the resource's created URI), `args` (optional parser-specific options, including `{"parse_mode":"no_split"}` to parse each source document into one Markdown body, `{"feishu_access_token":"u-..."}` for one-time Feishu user-token imports, or access/refresh tokens plus an optional `feishu_app_id` / `feishu_app_secret` pair for Feishu user-token watches) |
| `add_skill` | Create, install, or replace an agent skill. New skills pass the full SKILL.md text; Git and GitHub tree URLs install every skill in the source unless `skills` names some; a local SKILL.md, directory, or zip returns a signed upload URL like `add_resource` | `data` (SKILL.md text) or `path` (Git URL or local path), `skills` (optional), `target_uri` (optional; `viking://agent/skills` shares with the account), `list_only` (optional) |
| `list_watches` | List watch tasks (auto-refresh subscriptions) visible to the current agent. Each entry shows target URI, refresh interval (minutes), active/paused status, and next scheduled execution time | none |
| `cancel_watch` | Cancel (delete) a watch task by its target URI. To change the cadence or pause temporarily, cancel and re-add with a new `watch_interval` | `to_uri` (must match the watch task's `to` value, e.g. `viking://resources/...`) |
| `grep` | Regex content search across `viking://` files | `uri`, `pattern` (string or array), `case_insensitive`, `node_limit` |
| `glob` | Find files matching a glob pattern | `pattern`, `uri` (optional scope), `node_limit` |
| `forget` | Delete any `viking://` URI (use `search` to find it first; pass `recursive=true` to delete a directory). Deleting a skill directory this way leaves the skill's privacy configuration behind; remove a skill with `ov skills remove` or `DELETE /api/v1/skills/{name}` | `uri`, `recursive` (optional) |
| `health` | Check OpenViking service health | none |

To address your own workspace from an MCP tool, use the home alias `viking://~`. It
expands to `viking://user/<current-user>` on every control plane (REST API, `ov` CLI,
SDKs, and MCP alike), so `viking://~/notes/todo.md` resolves to
`viking://user/<current-user>/notes/todo.md`. Responses always echo the expanded
canonical URI, and those canonical URIs are accepted as tool input as well.

The uid-less spelling `viking://user/<segment>/...` (`memories`, `resources`, `skills`,
`peers`, `privacy`, `sessions`) is no longer accepted; such calls fail with an error that
points at the `viking://~/...` replacement. `viking://user` on its own is the container of
user spaces, not a shortcut to yours. See
[Viking URI](../concepts/04-viking-uri.md) for details.

> **Note**: MCP exposes the minimum closure for watch management (`list_watches` + `cancel_watch`). Pause / resume / trigger and the unified `update` verb are intentionally not exposed here — use the REST `/api/v1/watches/*` endpoints or the `ov task watch` CLI for those operations.

> Feishu/Lark imports without `args.feishu_access_token` keep the existing app/tenant-token behavior and can be watched. One-time user-token imports pass only `args.feishu_access_token`; user-token watches must also pass `args.feishu_refresh_token`. They may pass `args.feishu_app_id` and `args.feishu_app_secret` together for that watch, or fall back to the server app credentials. The app must match the issuer of the user token.

> `processing_mode=vectors_only` skips the VLM semantic-understanding stage. It does not generate or refresh `.abstract.md` / `.overview.md`; it only vectorizes current non-hidden resource files, preserving any older semantic artifacts that already exist.

### Adding local-file resources (single-step upload)

The `add_resource` tool accepts both **remote URLs** and **local file paths**, handled differently:

- **Remote URL** (`http(s)://`, `git@`, `ssh://`, `git://`): single round-trip — the server fetches and ingests directly.
- **Local file path**: the tool returns an **upload instruction** (plain prose). The agent POSTs the file as `multipart/form-data` (field name `file`) to the `temp_upload` URL given in the response. The URL embeds a one-shot token (10-minute TTL by default) that authorizes the upload, so no API key is needed. The server then ingests the file **automatically in the same request** and returns the final result — the agent does **not** call `add_resource` again.

This lets any MCP client — including sandboxed environments without a local filesystem (Claude web, Manus, etc.) — push files into OpenViking without pre-installing the `ov` CLI. The token upload reuses the authenticated `temp_upload` route (API key first, otherwise the one-shot `?token=`) and its `TempUploadStore` persistence, so the same `local` / `shared` upload modes apply. Note: the one-shot token is held in-process, so in a multi-worker deployment the `add_resource` call and the follow-up upload POST must reach the same worker (or run single-worker) for the token to resolve.

#### When you must set `OPENVIKING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`

The upload URL the tool returns is resolved server-side in this order:

1. Environment variable `OPENVIKING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`
2. `server.public_base_url` in `ov.conf`
3. Request headers `X-Forwarded-Host` / `X-Forwarded-Proto` (forwarded by the reverse-proxy chain)
4. Request `Host` header (direct connection)
5. Listen-address fallback: `http://{host}:{port}`

If the server runs behind a reverse proxy (nginx / cloud LB / k8s ingress / MCP proxy), **set `OPENVIKING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` explicitly**. Layers 3–5 are inferred and break in these cases:

- The reverse proxy / MCP proxy does not forward `X-Forwarded-*` headers
- The server listens on `0.0.0.0` (fallback URL contains `0.0.0.0`, unreachable from agents)
- Multi-hop proxy with host rewriting

When the variable is unset and inference is used, the tool response automatically appends a hint asking the user to configure it. Docker Compose example:

```yaml
services:
  openviking:
    # Prefer ghcr.io. If it is hard to reach, use openviking-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com/volcengine/openviking:latest
    image: ghcr.io/volcengine/openviking:latest
    environment:
      OPENVIKING_PUBLIC_BASE_URL: "https://ov.your-domain.com"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection refused

**Likely cause:** `openviking-server` is not running, or is running on a different port.

**Fix:** Verify the server is running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:1933/health
# Expected: {"status": "ok"}
```

### Authentication errors

**Likely cause:** API key mismatch between client config and server config.

**Fix:** Ensure the API key in your MCP client configuration matches the one in your OpenViking server configuration. See [Authentication Guide](04-authentication.md).
