# Agent Integrations Overview

OpenViking can act as the long-term memory and context backend for many agent runtimes. Pick the integration that matches your agent.

## Compare integrations side by side

For the concrete differences between integrations — tool surface, automatic recall, session and commit behaviour, compaction takeover, degradation and fault tolerance — see the [Capability Reference](./16-capability-reference.md), a cross-integration comparison matrix.

## Developing and maintaining plugins

To add or maintain an integration, follow the [Hook + MCP Agent Plugin Development and Maintenance Standard](./18-plugin-development.md). When using VibeCoding, require your coding agent to read and follow it before making changes, using Claude Code, Codex, and other existing plugins as implementation references.

## Prerequisite for all integrations

Every integration on this page connects to a running OpenViking server. If you don't have one yet, follow the [Quickstart Guide](../getting-started/02-quickstart.md). The default endpoint is `http://localhost:1933`; remote use requires an API key (see [Authentication](../guides/04-authentication.md)).

## Low-latency recall

Query expansion and recall-result compression are two independent, optional model calls. Disable both in the Agent plugin when response latency matters most; semantic retrieval, budgeting, tier degradation, and cross-turn dedup continue to work.

The same environment variables apply to both the Claude Code and Codex memory plugins. Query expansion is switchable in every memory plugin that resolves its settings through the shared loader; compression is Claude Code and Codex only.

```bash
export OPENVIKING_RECALL_QUERY_EXPANSION=off
export OPENVIKING_RECALL_COMPRESS=off
```

Both plugins have a local compression path, but expose it differently:

- Claude Code defaults to `recallCompress=auto`: it prefers local `claude -p` (Sonnet with low effort) and falls back to an OpenViking server digest when the local CLI is unavailable. `client` forces local-only compression, while `server` forces server-only compression.
- Codex calls local `codex exec` by default, trying `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` first and then `gpt-5.6-luna` with low effort. It does not enable server-side compression.

The shared default is `recallCompress=auto`. `OPENVIKING_RECALL_COMPRESS=off` disables compression in both plugins; Codex interprets `auto` or `client` as enabling its local compressor. The old Claude Code variable `OPENVIKING_RECALL_REWRITE` remains supported for compatibility, but new configurations should use the unified name.

The same settings can live in `~/.openviking/ovcli.conf`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://openviking.example.com",
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "plugin": {
    "recallQueryExpansion": "off",
    "recallCompress": "off"
  }
}
```

Environment variables take precedence over `ovcli.conf`. Restart the Agent after changing these settings so its hook processes reload the configuration. These are plugin-client settings; the server's `ov.conf` does not need to change.

The `plugin` section is read by every memory plugin — claude-code, codex, cursor, trae, trae-cn, zcode, kimicode, opencode, dsh and pi — and a `plugin.<harness>` object overrides the shared keys for one of them, under either spelling (`claude_code` or `claude-code`, `trae_cn` or `trae-cn`). Compression is the exception: the other harnesses honour `recallQueryExpansion` but ignore `recallCompress` and its companions, since none of them requests a server digest.

A context request waits longer than an ordinary request, because aborting it client-side discards the whole response rather than just the stage that ran long. The server pipeline is serial and each optional stage has its own fuse: query expansion (`retrieval.recall_intent_timeout_s`, 5s) runs first, then retrieval, body reads and budgeting, and only then the digest rewrite (`retrieval.recall_rewrite_timeout_s`, 30s). The deadline therefore follows what the request actually asks for — 15s once it carries a session and can spend the expansion fuse, 45s when it also asks for a digest, and the plugin's ordinary timeout when it asks for neither. Set `OPENVIKING_RECALL_CONTEXT_TIMEOUT_MS` (or `plugin.recallContextTimeoutMs`) to pin it — keep it above the fuses the request will spend and below the Agent's own hook timeout.
