# Memory Plugin Shared Library

For contributor guidance on adding and maintaining hook + MCP integrations, see the [Agent plugin development and maintenance standard](../../docs/en/agent-integrations/18-plugin-development.md) ([中文](../../docs/zh/agent-integrations/18-plugin-development.md)). When using a coding agent, have it read and follow this standard before making changes.

This directory contains shared JavaScript modules. `sync.mjs` vendors each module into the plugins whose code imports it — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, dsh, pi, openclaw and the bundled `agent-plugins` servers — together with the matching `lib/*.d.mts` declaration for the targets written in TypeScript. cursor, trae, trae-cn and zcode vendor nothing: the installer copies the modules `lib/MANIFEST` names — the same sync writes it — to `$OV_HOME/agent-integrations/memory-plugin-shared/lib`, and they import it from there.

`lib/install/` is the exception: it holds the installer's own JavaScript — the JSONC editor OpenCode's config needs and the hooks/mcp merge cursor, trae, trae-cn and zcode install through — which runs from `install.sh` and never from a hook. No shared module imports it, so it stays out of every closure and out of `lib/MANIFEST`.

When the copies are made follows how the plugin is delivered. Claude Code, Codex and `agent-plugins` are installed by pointing a host at a directory in this repository, so their copies are committed and a push to main regenerates them. OpenCode, dsh and openclaw publish as npm packages and pi is tarred by the installer, so those build their copies at pack time and keep none in git — run `node examples/memory-plugin-shared/sync.mjs` once in a fresh checkout before running their tests.

## Workspace Peers

`lib/workspace-peer.mjs` decides which peer a workspace writes its memories under; `lib/workspace-identity.mjs` derives the values it substitutes.

The peer used to be the working directory with every non-alphanumeric character replaced by `-`, so `/Users/x/Dev/OpenViking` became `-Users-x-Dev-OpenViking`. That made the identity an accident of where the repository sat: a clone on another machine, a rename, a git worktree, or simply working from a subdirectory each minted a separate, empty namespace. The default is now git's own identity, so one project keeps one memory wherever it is checked out. A directory that is not a repository sends no peer at all, and what is remembered there goes to your user-level space at `viking://user/<you>/memories` — an application that opens a fresh directory for every task would otherwise mint a fresh, empty peer for every task.

`peer.source` picks the rule. It is read from `OPENVIKING_PEER_SOURCE`, from `plugin.peerSource` / `plugin.<harness>.peerSource` in `ovcli.conf`, or from `peer.source` in a [workspace config file](#workspace-configuration):

- `git` — the default. Equivalent to the template list `["{git_remote}", "{git_root}"]`: the normalized `origin` URL, else the repository root path. Outside a repository nothing is sent. No prefix is added.
- `cwd` — the previous behaviour, byte for byte.
- `none` — send no peer at all. `OPENVIKING_WORKSPACE_PEER=0` still means this.
- A template such as `"git-{git_remote}"` or `"team-{dir}"`, or a list of templates tried in order. A template whose variables are empty falls through to the next one, so a half-substituted id is never sent.

The variables a template may use:

- `{git_remote}` — the normalized `origin` URL as `github.com-org-repo`; empty outside a git repository, or when there is no `origin`.
- `{git_root}` — the repository root path, legacy sanitation; empty outside a git repository. A marker file inside a repository still leaves this the repository's own root, so marking a subdirectory does not split the default peer.
- `{cwd}` — the working directory, legacy sanitation; never empty, and in no default chain, so a bare path becomes a peer only when you ask for one.
- `{dir}` — the workspace root's directory name: the repository root, or the directory holding `.openviking/config.json`; empty when the directory is not a workspace.
- `{harness}` — the name of the agent running, the same one the User-Agent carries; never empty. No preset uses it, so agents share one repository's memory unless a template such as `"{git_remote}-{harness}"` asks them not to. The MCP proxy takes no part in derivation, so a read path that goes only through it cannot resolve it.

To give a directory that is not a repository its own peer, create `.openviking/config.json` there holding `{"version": 1, "peer": {"id": "my-project"}}`.

So in `/Users/x/Dev/OpenViking/examples/codex-memory-plugin` with origin `git@github.com:volcengine/OpenViking.git`, the peer is `github.com-volcengine-openviking` — the same from any subdirectory, any worktree, any machine, any clone.

Every clone of one repository therefore shares one peer: project memory follows the project. A fork has a different origin, so it stays separate by default; reviewing an external PR through `gh pr checkout` leaves `origin` alone and does not move the identity. Worktrees converge through `commondir`, a submodule keeps its own identity, and `$HOME` and `/` are never workspace roots. The URL is normalized so ssh and https spellings of one repo agree, and an embedded token can never reach the peer id. The whole derivation is pure filesystem work — no `git` subprocess — so it also holds where `git` is absent from `PATH` or would refuse the repository over dubious ownership.

Resolution order is:

1. Explicit peer: `OPENVIKING_PEER_ID`, then `peer.id` in a workspace layer or `peerId` in `ovcli.conf`'s `plugin` section, then `actor_peer_id` / `peer_id` in `ovcli.conf`, then the harness's own section of `ov.conf`.
2. The peer derived by `peer.source`, when `workspacePeer` is not `false`.
3. No peer.

Migrating from the path-derived peer needs no action. The old id can always be recomputed locally, so recall still reaches memories written under it: with the default `peer_scope: "all"` the server's existing cross-peer sweep already covers them at zero cost, and with `peer_scope: "actor"` the plugin asks that peer separately. There is no deadline on this, and `peer.source: "cwd"` restores the old id outright.

## Recall Peer Scope

`lib/recall-core.mjs` defaults to the broad recall mode and does not send a
`peer_scope` field. In that mode, the server can recall global memory, the
current workspace, and other workspace memories; other workspaces are penalized
and rendered later.

When `recallPeerScope` is `actor`, the helper sends `peer_scope:"actor"`. This
is the isolation mode: recall only sees global memory plus the current
workspace. If an older server rejects that field with 400 or 422, `postRecall`
removes `peer_scope` and retries once.

For deployments where one bot serves multiple real people, such as zouk,
vikingbot, or AstrBot, configure an explicit actor peer and use the isolation
mode so one person's memories are not recalled into another person's session.

## Skill Catalog

`lib/profile-inject.mjs` ends the session-start block with `<available-skills>`, built from one `GET /api/v1/skills?node_limit=200`, which caps each root rather than the merged list: the user's own skills first, then the ones shared under `viking://agent/skills` (a shared skill whose name the user also owns is left out), each description cut to about 40 tokens. Nothing trims the list again on this side; the token budget decides what fits. Callers turn it on by passing their resolved config as `buildProfileBlock()`'s fourth argument, and claude-code, codex, cursor, trae, trae-cn, zcode, opencode, dsh and pi all do, so they build it the same way; openclaw and hermes inject no profile, and `pi-experimental-context-management` calls `buildProfileBlock()` without that argument.

`skillCatalog` (default `true`, `OPENVIKING_SKILL_CATALOG`) switches it, and `skillCatalogTokenBudget` (default `1200`, range 0-20000, `OPENVIKING_SKILL_CATALOG_TOKEN_BUDGET`) sizes it on its own, apart from `profileTokenBudget`; a budget of `0` also switches it off. When the descriptions do not fit, the block lists names only, ending with a `... +N more` tail if even the names do not all fit; when not even one name fits, it becomes a one-line count. With no skills, or a server without the endpoint, there is no block.

## Workspace Configuration

`lib/workspace-config.mjs` and `lib/workspace-registry.mjs` give a repository three configuration layers of its own: `<repo-root>/.openviking/config.json`, which the team commits, `<repo-root>/.openviking/config.local.json`, which stays private and gitignored, and a per-machine entry at `~/.openviking/workspaces/<slot>.json`. Precedence, highest first:

1. `OPENVIKING_*` environment variables
2. the machine registry, `~/.openviking/workspaces/<slot>.json`
3. `.openviking/config.local.json`
4. `.openviking/config.json`
5. `ovcli.conf` `plugin.<harness>`
6. `ovcli.conf` `plugin`
7. the block in `ov.conf` named after the harness (legacy). Both its credential fields and its tuning knobs reach every harness, and for dsh it sits under the settings the cordis host hands the plugin
8. built-in defaults

Every harness resolves every knob through that order: claude-code, codex, cursor, trae, trae-cn, zcode, opencode, dsh and pi. One `plugin` section therefore configures all of them, and `ov config switch` moves behaviour along with credentials. Inside `plugin`, a per-harness override is found under either spelling of the harness name, so `claude_code` and `claude-code`, `trae_cn` and `trae-cn` both reach the same object.

The knobs themselves are declared once in `lib/config-schema.mjs`, with each one's type, default, range, `OPENVIKING_*` variable and older spellings. An older spelling keeps working: `syncTurns` sets `autoCapture`, `bypassPatterns` sets `bypassSessionPatterns`, `recallRewrite` sets `recallCompress`, `requestTimeoutMs` sets `timeoutMs`, `recallBudget` sets `recallTokenBudget`, `recallScoreThreshold` sets `scoreThreshold`, `recallMinQueryLength` sets `minQueryLength`, `profileBudget` sets `profileTokenBudget`, `recallCompressReasoningEffort` sets `recallCompressThinking`, `auth_mode` sets `authMode`, and `peer_id` sets `peerId`.

Every file declares `version: 1`; one declaring another version is skipped with a warning. Schema v1 is `peer.source`, `peer.id`, `recall.enabled`, `recall.peer_scope`, `recall.dedup_turns`, `recall.max_items`, `recall.score_threshold`, `capture.enabled`, `capture.commit_token_threshold`, `bypass.session_patterns`, and `labels`. Lists union across layers, and a leading `"!reset"` clears what was inherited. Unknown keys are kept and ignored.

Workspace files are trusted without a prompt: a hook is non-interactive, and an approval gate would degrade into one command per workspace. What is refused instead is structural — connection and credential keys (`url`, `api_key`, `account`, `user`, `extra_headers`, …) are stripped with a warning and `${VAR}` is never expanded in these files. What a committed file switches off is announced in `ov-memory-doctor` rather than blocked.

`.gitignore` must not ignore all of `.openviking/`, or `config.json` can never be committed. Narrow the rule to `.openviking/media/` and `.openviking/downloads/`; doctor warns while it is still blanket.

## Cloud recall compression

`OPENVIKING_RECALL_COMPRESS=server` enables cloud compression across Claude Code,
Codex, OpenCode, DSH, Pi, the Cursor/Trae/Trae CN/ZCode hooks, OpenClaw, and Hermes.
The context-search request sends `rewrite: true`; the server digest is preferred
over raw rendered context, and `stats.rewrite: "no_relevant"` suppresses injection.

Claude Code and Codex also support `client` for local-only compression. Their
`auto` mode uses local compression when available and otherwise sends
`rewrite: "auto"`. Harnesses without local compressors send `rewrite: "auto"`
directly. Their existing default remains `off`; cloud compression is opt-in.
`off` omits rewrite. The legacy boolean aliases `1` and `0` mean `auto` and `off`.

These settings apply to automatic recall. Explicit MCP search calls retain the
arguments supplied by the caller. Cloud compression requires a server that
supports the context-search rewrite API; older-server fallback behavior remains
specific to each integration.
