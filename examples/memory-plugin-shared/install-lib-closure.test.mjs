/**
 * What the installer ships must equal what the shipped code imports.
 *
 * cursor, trae and zcode have no vendored copy of the shared runtime: the
 * installer assembles one in `$OV_HOME/agent-integrations/memory-plugin-shared/lib`
 * by copying the modules `lib/MANIFEST` names. A module the manifest forgets is
 * an ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on the first hook of a fresh install, and one it
 * carries that nothing imports is dead weight nobody notices. The manifest is
 * generated from those sources by the same code that decides what the vendoring
 * targets ship, so it can only drift by not being regenerated — which is what
 * this asserts.
