// directories while a module somebody did import went missing and became an
// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND on the first hook of a fresh install. Each target below
// only says where its code lives, where its copies go, and whether the copies
// have to be committed; the file set is the transitive closure of what that
// code actually imports.

// `committed` is about how the plugin is delivered, not about taste. A host
// that installs by pointing at a directory in this repository can only see
// files git has, so those copies are committed and a bot regenerates them on
// main. A plugin published as an npm package or assembled into a tarball builds
// its copies at pack time, so committing them would only tax every review diff.
