/**
 * Pi OpenViking Extension — EXPERIMENTAL context management
 *
 * A fork of examples/pi-coding-agent-extension whose takeover mode is replaced
 * by agent-driven context windows: the model decides when a window ends, calls
 * `new_context`, and the extension archives the conversation to OpenViking and
 * cuts it out of the next provider request, leaving a frozen window header with
 * the Working Memory and the model's own handoff notes. `history` reads the
 * archived windows back, `get_context_remaining` reports the pressure. Turns
 * still sync to an OpenViking session and recall is still injected into the
 * newest user message.
 *
 * Do not load this together with the openviking extension — they would both
 * register overlapping tools and both sync the same OV session. As a backstop
 * this one stands down as soon as it sees the peer, by either of two signals:
 * a search tool registered from another extension's directory (`viking_search`
 * before 0.4, `openviking_search` from 0.4 on), or the
 * `globalThis.__OPENVIKING_PI_EXTENSION__` marker the peer sets once it is
 * connected and not bypassed. The marker is what covers the dangerous case:
 * when `/mcp` answers 401/403 or the handshake times out the peer registers no
 * tool at all and still writes the OV session, so no tool name is there to see.
 * Both signals are re-checked on every event boundary because the peer arrives
 * only after a network round trip.

const CONTEXT_WINDOW_GUIDANCE = `<context-window-management>
You manage your own context window in this session. When the conversation grows it is not summarized behind your back: you decide when the current window ends, and OpenViking archives it so you can read it back afterwards.

Three tools do this:
- new_context — archive the current window and continue in a fresh one. OpenViking generates a Working Memory of the archived window, and your next window opens with that Working Memory, your handoff notes and the user's most recent request.
- history — read windows that were already archived: list_windows, list_items, read_item, search_contents. Closing a window loses nothing; it only stops being in front of you.
- get_context_remaining — how much room is left, how long this window has been open, and how long it has been since the user's last message.

Start a new window when:
- a phase of the work is finished and its details no longer matter for what comes next;
- the user switches to an unrelated topic or a different area of the code;
- the user comes back after a long idle gap with something new;
- the status line or get_context_remaining says the window is filling up — act when their advice line asks you to, and never ignore a [context-reminder]. If you wait until the window overflows, the harness compacts the conversation for you and your notes are never written.

Do not start a new window:
- in the middle of an edit sequence you have not verified;
- immediately after a reset;
- to get away from a problem you have not solved — the new window carries the same problem with less information.

Write the notes before you call new_context: the goal, the decisions and why you made them, what is finished, what is in flight, exact file paths and identifiers, and the next steps. Write them for someone who has not seen this conversation, because that is exactly what your next window is. Call new_context alone — tool results from the same batch are discarded together with the old window.

If new_context answers with "Context window NOT reset", nothing was archived and nothing was removed from your context: read the reason it gives, keep working in the current window, and do not call it again until that reason is gone.

In a new window, read the <openviking-context source="context-window"> block first: it carries the Working Memory, your notes and the request that is still pending. Use history for anything it does not cover, and never ask the user to repeat something an archived window already holds.
