/**
 * Per-harness plugin settings from ovcli.conf.
 *
 * ovcli.conf carried connection fields only, so every harness had to keep its
 * tuning knobs in ov.conf's harness section — a server-side file that a
 * client-side plugin has no business editing. The `plugin` section fixes that:
 * shared keys apply to every harness that reads them, and a per-harness object
 * overrides them.
 *
 *   {
 *     "url": "...", "api_key": "...",
 *     "plugin": {
 *       "recallQueryExpansion": "off",
 *       "recallCompress": "auto"
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 * Resolution stays env → ovcli.conf plugin.<harness> → ovcli.conf plugin →
 * ov.conf harness section (legacy) → defaults.
 *
 * Every harness resolves through `resolveSettings()` below, and assembles its
 * whole configuration through `buildPluginConfig()`, so one `plugin` section
 * configures all of them and `ov config switch` moves behaviour along with
 * credentials. The knobs themselves are declared once in `config-schema.mjs`;
 * this module decides which files supply them and what is derived from them.
